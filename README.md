# 🚀 Kubernetes (K8s) Installation on Ubuntu Linux: A Quick & Easy Guide 🐧🐳

Welcome to the ultimate **Kubernetes installation guide** for **Ubuntu Linux**!

## 💡 Introduction

Kubernetes (often abbreviated as **K8s**) is the leading open-source platform for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.  

**Minikube** lets you run Kubernetes locally by creating a single-node cluster on your machine. This is ideal for learning, development, and testing purposes.  

Docker is the container runtime that Minikube uses to run containers in your local cluster.

## 🛠️ Installation Steps

Follow these commands in order. Each command includes a brief description.

---

### 1. Update & Upgrade System Packages 🔄

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
```
*Update package lists and upgrade all existing packages to their latest versions.*

---

### 2. Install Docker 🐳

```bash
sudo apt install -y docker.io
```
*Install Docker engine, which is required by Minikube to create containers.*

---

### 3. Enable & Start Docker Service 🔥

```bash
sudo systemctl enable docker
sudo systemctl start docker
```
*Enable Docker to start on boot and start the Docker daemon.*

---

### 4. Add Your User to the Docker Group 👤

```bash
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
```
*Allows running Docker commands without needing `sudo` by adding your user to the Docker group.*

---

### 5. Download & Install Minikube 🚀

```bash
curl -LO https://storage.googleapis.com/minikube/releases/latest/minikube-linux-amd64
sudo install minikube-linux-amd64 /usr/local/bin/minikube
```
*Download the latest Minikube binary and install it in your executable path.*

---

### 6. Install Kubernetes Dependencies 🛡️

```bash
sudo apt install -y apt-transport-https ca-certificates curl
```
*Install packages required to add Kubernetes APT repository.*

---

### 7. Add Kubernetes GPG Key & APT Repository 🔑

```bash
sudo curl -fsSLo /usr/share/keyrings/kubernetes-archive-keyring.gpg https://packages.cloud.google.com/apt/doc/apt-key.gpg
echo "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/kubernetes-archive-keyring.gpg] https://apt.kubernetes.io/ kubernetes-xenial main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/kubernetes.list
```
*Add the official Kubernetes package signing key and repository.*

---

### 8. Update Package List & Install kubectl 🛠️

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo snap install kubectl --classic
```
*Update package lists and install kubectl via Snap. `kubectl` is the CLI tool for Kubernetes cluster management.*

---

### 9. Start Minikube Cluster with Docker Driver 🐳

```bash
minikube start --driver=docker
```
*Start a local Kubernetes cluster with Docker as the virtualization driver.*

---

## ✅ Verify Installation

Check the status of your Kubernetes nodes:

```bash
kubectl get nodes
```
*You should see one node with the status "Ready". This confirms your cluster is running smoothly.*
